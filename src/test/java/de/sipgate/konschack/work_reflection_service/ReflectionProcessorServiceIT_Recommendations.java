    /**
     * IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EXISTING TEST METHODS
     * 
     * 1. add.reflectionWithCorrectDate
     * - Create a ReflectionPrompt with a specific date and prompt text
     * - Call componentUnderTest.process() with the prompt
     * - Verify that the reflection can be retrieved using componentUnderTest.getReflectionForDate()
     * - Verify that the retrieved reflection has the correct date and content
     * - Verify that a markdown file was created in the reflections directory
     * 
     * Example:
     * ```
     * // Arrange
     * LocalDate testDate = LocalDate.now();
     * String promptText = "Test reflection prompt";
     * ReflectionPrompt prompt = new ReflectionPrompt(testDate, promptText);
     * 
     * // Act
     * Reflection result = componentUnderTest.process(prompt);
     * 
     * // Assert
     * assertNotNull(result);
     * assertEquals(testDate, result.date());
     * assertFalse(result.content().isEmpty());
     * 
     * // Verify it was stored in vector store
     * Reflection retrieved = componentUnderTest.getReflectionForDate(testDate);
     * assertEquals(testDate, retrieved.date());
     * assertEquals(result.content(), retrieved.content());
     * 
     * // Verify markdown file was created
     * Path filePath = Paths.get("reflections", "reflection-" + testDate.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd")) + ".md");
     * assertTrue(Files.exists(filePath));
     * String fileContent = Files.readString(filePath);
     * assertEquals(result.content(), fileContent);
     * 
     * // Clean up
     * Files.deleteIfExists(filePath);
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. add.secondReflectionWithSameDate
     * - Create and process a first ReflectionPrompt with a specific date
     * - Create and process a second ReflectionPrompt with the same date
     * - Verify that both reflections are stored (using componentUnderTest.getAll())
     * - Verify that getReflectionForDate() returns one of them (likely the most recent)
     * - Verify that two markdown files were created or that the content was appended
     * 
     * 3. get.reflectionsForDate
     * - Create and process a ReflectionPrompt with a specific date
     * - Call componentUnderTest.getReflectionForDate() with that date
     * - Verify that the returned reflection has the correct date and content
     * - Test with a date that has no reflection and verify appropriate behavior
     * 
     * 4. list.allReflections
     * - Create and process multiple ReflectionPrompts with different dates
     * - Call componentUnderTest.getAll()
     * - Verify that all created reflections are in the returned list
     * - Verify that the list is ordered correctly (if there's a specific order)
     * 
     * 5. sim.toSpecificKeyword
     * - Create and process multiple ReflectionPrompts with different content
     * - Call componentUnderTest.findSimilar() with a keyword that should match some reflections
     * - Verify that the returned list contains the expected reflections
     * - Test with a keyword that shouldn't match any reflections
     * 
     * 
     * ADDITIONAL TEST METHODS
     * 
     * 1. Test error handling
     * - Test with null or invalid inputs
     * - Test with edge cases like empty strings, very long strings, special characters
     * 
     * 2. Test getReflectionsAfterDate
     * - Create reflections with dates before and after a specific date
     * - Call componentUnderTest.getReflectionsAfterDate() with that date
     * - Verify that only reflections after that date are returned
     * 
     * 3. Test persistence
     * - Create a reflection
     * - Restart the application or create a new instance of the service
     * - Verify that the reflection can still be retrieved
     * 
     * 4. Test file I/O errors
     * - Mock Files.writeString to throw an IOException
     * - Verify that the service handles the error gracefully
     * 
     * 5. Test with real AI responses
     * - Create reflections with prompts that should generate specific types of responses
     * - Verify that the AI generates appropriate content
     * 
     * 6. Test with multiple reflections for the same date
     * - Create multiple reflections for the same date
     * - Verify that all reflections are stored and can be retrieved
     * 
     * 7. Test with dates in the past and future
     * - Create reflections with dates in the past and future
     * - Verify that they are stored and retrieved correctly
     * 
     * 8. Test with boundary dates
     * - Test with very old dates and very future dates
     * - Test with date boundaries like leap years, month boundaries
     * 
     * 9. Test vector store search functionality
     * - Create reflections with specific content
     * - Test different similarity thresholds and topK values
     * - Verify that the search returns the expected results
     * 
     * 10. Test concurrent access
     * - Create multiple threads that create and retrieve reflections
     * - Verify that there are no concurrency issues
     * 
     * 11. Test performance
     * - Create a large number of reflections
     * - Measure the time it takes to retrieve them
     * - Verify that performance is acceptable
     * 
     * 12. Test integration with MyChatClient
     * - Mock the MyChatClient to return specific responses
     * - Verify that the service processes the responses correctly
     * 
     * 13. Test integration with VectorStore
     * - Mock the VectorStore to return specific results
     * - Verify that the service processes the results correctly
